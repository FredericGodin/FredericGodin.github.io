Hi, my name is Fr√©deric Godin. I am currently leading Generative AI at [Sinch](https://sinch.com) and numerous other AI initiatives.

Before getting acquired by Sinch, I was the lead machine learning engineer at [Chatlayer](https://chatlayer.ai/), where I built a speech recognition engine for Flemish and worked on the NLP engine of the chatbot platform.

Previously, I was a Ph.D. researcher at the [IDLab of Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en), Belgium. I have mainly worked on natural language processing projects but also have experience with speech processing and image processing.
